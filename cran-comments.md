No revdep authors were emailed as it is only small bug fixes or 'Suggest' dependency change for Brian.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do.  Thank you for your time.

Best,
Barret

As ยง1.1.3.1 of the manual told you, packages in Suggests: should be used
conditionally.  The latest version of igraph will not install on Solaris
(hence packages strictly depending on it), and as you can see from its
CRAN checks page, your package now fails its check.

Please correct ASAP and definitely within a month.

## Reverse dependencies
I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of jgally on my local machine.
