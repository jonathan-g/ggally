# [jgally](http://github.com/jonathan-g/jgally): Extension to [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-g/jgally.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-g/jgally)


[ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) is a plotting system for R based on the grammar of graphics. [jgally](https://github.com/jonathan-g/jgally) extends ggplot2 by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geoms with transformed data.  Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a scatterplot plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.
